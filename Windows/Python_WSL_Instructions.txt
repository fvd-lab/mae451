4.2) if wsl not visible or does not open, run the Ubuntu app by hitting windows key and searching for and running the Ubuntu program

5.) In the WSL terminal, create an account if its your first time. This requires you to put a username, hitting enter, then entering the password (NOTE: While typing the password in the terminal, the system is recording the keystrokes but does not show any typed characters [i.e. will appear blank but the password is in there when typed]), hit enter, then confirm the password by typing it again when prompted. 

6.) Close your WSL windows and re-open using the 'Run as Administrator option'

    Press the Windows key and open a "Power Shell"

    (replace <your-username> with your WSL username from step 4 or 5)

        cp /home/$USER/software/mae451/Windows/get_linux_packages.txt /home/$USER/software/mae451/Windows/get_linux_packages.sh
        chmod 777 /home/$USER/software/mae451/Windows/get_linux_packages.sh
        cd /home/$USER/software/mae451/Windows
        ./get_linux_packages.sh

    (you may have to input your pasword and hit {Y, [enter]} a few times)

9.) In the wsl, run: 

    cd /home/$USER/software
    wget https://repo.anaconda.com/archive/Anaconda3-2025.06-1-Linux-x86_64.sh

(different versions can be found on repo.anaconda.com/archive/)

10.) After the download is finished, run this command in the wsl terminal:

    cd /home/$USER/software
    bash Anaconda3-2025.06-1-Linux-x86_64.sh -p /home/$USER/software/anaconda3

(you may have to use your actual username instead of $USER here)

11.) Run the following:

    cd /home/$USER/software
    rm -rf Anaconda3-2025.06-1-Linux-x86_64.sh

15.) To update all existing packages, run:

    conda update --all

16.) If you wish to use VS Code, from the wsl, type:

    code .

(you may also simply open the application)

Click checkmark to permantly allow access to the folder

Click the box for access to all the files in home and say you trust the authors

17.) After VSCode opens from the previous command, click the bottom left corner where the arrows are and change to WSL server. You know this worked when it says WSL: Ubuntu in the bottom left corner.
